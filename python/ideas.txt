A really fucking shit bot will give you good data on what is bad - but not good data on what is good. use this how you will

Eval Ideas:

-Put bot in really shit position and make sure eval is really shit
-Setup levels and see if the bot can make the correct decisions to win


Should I make player numbers 1-indexed????????

Make game sims have as little steps as possible- like isntead of move_racers(), then check for winners, just have a game_step() or some shit

-Parallelize the evaluation of multiple positions
    - Instead of inputting [1 position, 3, 10, 10] to model
    - Do [x positions, 3, 10, 10]

-Concurrency (multithreading) when running simulations?

-Is there any possibilty on NaNs coming out of my model?

-Use tch crate? onnxruntime crate (how is this differetn than ort)?
